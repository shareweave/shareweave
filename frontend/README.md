# Shareweave

## Develop Communities in Hours, not Months

Built on the arweave blockchain, shareweave makes it easy to create any sharing site, like a blog, support forum, hackernews clone, an unsplash-like site for amateur photographers, a publication, an awesome-list, or whatever else you can imagine! Shareweave handles storage, search, moderation, administration and more, so devs can focus on the important parts.

Made with sveltekit and typescript.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Building

```bash
yarn build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
