  <h1> Shareweave </h1>
  <p>the easiest way to implement content sharing</p>
</div>

Built on the arweave blockchain, shareweave makes it easy to create any sharing
site, like a blog, support forum, hackernews clone, an unsplash-like site for
amateur photographers, a publication, an awesome list, or whatever else you can
imagine! Shareweave handles storage, search, moderation, administration and
more, so devs can focus on the important parts.

Made with sveltekit and typescript. Contributions welcome!
